          <span>about me >>></span>
          <p>I arrived in Montreal four years ago and am now completing my degree in Intermedia and Cyber Arts at Concordia University, minoring in Design for Theatre. I co-directed the 2016 Art Matters Festival, for which I am currently curating a performing arts exhibition at artist-run-centre Eastern Bloc. Recently, I co-organized Tactile Museum (Eastern Bloc, 2016), an event facilitating collaboration between dancers and Fine Arts students, and assisted in producing the interdisciplinary conference Words and [ ] (Fonderie Darling, 2016). I have designed sets and collaborated on productions in festival circuits of Montreal, France, and Germany. I currently serve as an ambassador for Montreal performance centres Usine C and Tangente, while continuing my own practice.</p>
